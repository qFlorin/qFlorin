### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florin, and I do Front-end Development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Angular. I also enjoy UI, UX, and design in general.
My long-term goals include growing into a company where I can continue to learn new things, get new responsibilities, and contribute as much as possible to bringing value to the company.
